Control your media players from inside Vim, if you're really
that lazy 😏

## Commands
- `:Play`         => Begin playback from active media player
- `:Pause`        => Pause playback from active media player
- `:PauseAll`     => Pause playback from all runing media players
- `:Skip`         => Skip to next song
- `:Prev`         => Go back to previous song
- `:Restart`      => Replay current song from the beginning
- `:Mute`         => Mute audio for all media players
- `:Unmute`       => Unmute audio for all media players
- `:Quit`         => Send quit signal to active media player
- `:ActivePlayer` => Confirm active media player
- `:ChangePlayer` => Select active media player from list of all running/supported options

Please keep in mind that some media players may not have implemented MPRIS
fully/at all and available functionality can vary with each player.
